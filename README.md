# Jukebox
Proyect of a jukebox with  vivado (VHDL) realiced by Felix Soria, Sergio Vera and Alejandro Sumozas


This project was realiced by Felix Soria, Sergio Vera and Alejandro Sumozas, students of last couse in Electronics Engineerint at ETDISI, UPM (Madrid, Spain),
in the subject of Digital Industrial Systems.
The project is about a full functional Jukebox described in VHDL for the Nexys D4 FPGA, in which you can put coins in by pushing some buttons of the FPGA, 
then select the song you want and watch it by some displays, and finally listen to it thanks to a passive buzzer and a capacitor at a digital output singal.

We hope u like it!
